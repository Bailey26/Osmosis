Many people have packed schedules, and therefore limited time and energy to learn new things. But what if you could learn something new while waiting at the subway station or lunch line? That is where our app comes in: we aim to provide users with educational resources on a topic of their choice.

Users can populate our database with links, descriptions, and tags to resources of their choice (ex. videos, links to insightful blog posts). Users can also query our app with a title, link, or a search string related to their topic of interest (ex. “cats”). Our app will then query our database and return any videos with a matching title, url, or tags.

Besides querying for resources, the user can also rate (give 1-5 star rating) and review (give a short, written description of how helpful they found the resource) each of the resources returned by their query. 

While the results of each query will not be saved in our database, the user has the option of creating lists of resources that they like and adding resource bookmarks to these lists. Any resource that has been listed/bookmarked, rated, and/or reviewed will be stored in our database, and any user can view all of the ratings and reviews left for a resource.
